# Eldritch Horror

An RPG-flavoured **eldritch horror** mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge**. Sanity, corruption,
cults, forbidden rituals, and things that should not be — built as a progression system rather
than a monster pack.

> **Status: skeleton.** This repository currently contains the build, mod metadata, package
> layout, design documents and compiling placeholder registries. No gameplay is implemented yet.

## Design at a glance

The mod is built on three RPG axes and one progression engine:

| System | What it is | Player-facing |
|---|---|---|
| **Sanity** | A per-player meter that drains near the eldritch and recovers with rest/light. | The "health" of your mind; at zero, hallucinations and madness. |
| **Corruption** | A durable exposure value from forbidden knowledge and rituals; barely reversible. | The cost axis: power always leaves a mark. |
| **Cult reputation** | Faction standing gating rites, reagents and services. | Social progression; cults oppose each other. |
| **Rituals** | Data-driven altar recipes with a block pattern + offerings + outcomes. | Quest-like advancement and the mod's boss/content unlocks. |

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full design and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the code is laid out.

## Requirements

- **JDK 21** (Mojang ships Java 21 with 1.21.1).
- No Gradle install needed — the wrapper is committed (`./gradlew`).

## Build & run

```sh
./gradlew build                 # compile + build the mod jar (build/libs/)
./gradlew runClient             # launch a dev client with the mod
./gradlew runServer             # launch a dev server
./gradlew runData               # run data generators into src/generated/resources/
```

> The Gradle wrapper and ModDevGradle will download the Minecraft/NeoForge artifacts on first run.

## Contributing

The project is early; conventions are deliberately small:

- Keep the `@Mod` class thin — feature code belongs in its system package.
- One `DeferredRegister` per registry, in `registry/`, registered from the entry point.
- Never reference a `client/` class from common code path.
